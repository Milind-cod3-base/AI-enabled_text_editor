# What:

Using Python, I have build a text editor / notepad where one can type, copy, cut, paste etc.

# How:

Tkinter is the python's GUI library which makes this project possible.

# Upcoming upgrades:

After building a text editor:

=> Install a spelling and grammar check module

=> I wish to gain knowledge in Natural Language Processing (Machine learning subset) and implement in this text editor. By that, it will help the writer/author by predicting and recommeding him/her next words.
