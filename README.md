# What:

Using OpenAI's API and Tkinter library of Python, this text editor is built and is able to predict and autocomplete code, poem, essays, songs or even answering basic questions.


# How:

Just write a one line summary/pitch of what you want (more detailed summary will get more precise results) and press the Run command under BetterCallBot Menu.

for ex. "Suggest a name of baby boy" will give less precise results than "Suggest a name of Indian baby boy".

NOTE: Since OpenAI won't let their api keys be public, I have hidden in config.ini and ignored it via gitignore file. To get the keys, either login to OpenAI website and get new keys or kindly message me.

# Trivia:

BetterCallBot is a reference to Breaking bad's spin off "Better Call Saul" where a lawyer is called for help.
